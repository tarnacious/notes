## Password Store

I use `pass` to manage my passwords. It uses your PGP key to encrypt the
passwords. It's pretty easy to use: 

Create a password store:

    pass init 

Add a password:

    pass insert my_password_key

Get a password:

    pass my_password_key

## Generating passwords

`pwgen` is pretty nice for generating password, here is a simple example to create one password of length 10.

    pwgen 10 1
