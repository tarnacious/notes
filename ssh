# Ignore strict host checking temporarily

ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@server.com 

# Port forward through jump host

Given:

me -> jump-host -> hidden-host

The command below forwards port 8000 on the hidden-host through port 5000 on the jump-host to port 2000 on the local host.

ssh -A -v -t -L 2000:localhost:5000 user@jumphost ssh -t -L 5000:localhost:8000 user@hiddenhost

There are more modern ways to do this, but this works quite well on most system.


# ssh through jump host

```
ssh -tt vivek@Jumphost ssh -tt vivek@FooServer
```

# with proxy command

```
$ ssh -o ProxyCommand='ssh vivek@Jumphost nc FooServer 22' vivek@FooServer 
```

# with proxy command in ~/.ssh/config

```
Host server1
HostName v.server1
User root
Port 22
ProxyCommand ssh root@v.backup2 nc %h %p %r
```
