ddrescue is good for recovering data from partially broken disks.

ddrescue can also copy block devices to sparse files, which can be pretty useful.

  ddrescue -S -b8Mi /dev/sda1 /mount/external/backup/sda1.raw ~/sda1.rescue.log

dd_rescue is a different program with similar functionallity.

  dd_rescue -a -b 8M /dev/sda1 /mount/external/backup/sda1.raw
