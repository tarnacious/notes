# Bareos/Bacula Cheat Sheet
(take from https://workaround.org/bacula-cheatsheet/)

Bacula is a nifty backup software that is network-capable and stores data in the database for faster retrieval in case you need a certain file back. As a big fan of cheat sheets I created this cheat sheet.

## What’s up?
Which files shall be backed up?   show filesets   I=Included, E=Excluded
What’s the server doing?  status dir
What’s the status of a certain job?   status jobid=xx
What’s the client doing?  status client
What’s the streamer doing?  status storage
Anything new?   messages
Backing up
Start a backup  run   …and choose the backup job
Label a new tape  label   …and run mount afterwards
Restoring

The common way (a user accidentally removed a file and wants the newest version back from the tapes:

    Use the restore command.
    Choose option 5 (Select the most recent backup for a client).
    cd / ls / dir / mark / markdir / unmark / unmarkdir / lsmark / estimate / pwd / count / find
    done

Jobs
Last jobs   list jobs   …or list jobid=xx’ for a specific job
Statistics about last jobs  list jobtotal
Which files were backed up?   list files jobid=xx
Job status
