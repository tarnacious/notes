## Compare a file in two branches

    git diff branch1 branch2 filename 


## Delete a local branch

    git branch -d branch_name

## Delete a remote branch 

    git push origin --delete branch_name
    git push origin :branch_name

## Remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote.

    git fetch --all --prune

## Delete untracked files

Show untracked files (dry run). Adding -x also removes ignored files.

    git clean -f -n

Delete them

    git clean -f

## Are branches merged

    git branch --merged master  # lists branches merged into master

    git branch --merged  # lists branches merged into HEAD (i.e. tip of current branch)

    git branch --no-merged # lists branches that have not been merged

By default this applies to only the local branches. The -a flag will show both
local and remote branches, and the -r flag shows only the remote branches.

## Soft reset last commit

git reset HEAD~
